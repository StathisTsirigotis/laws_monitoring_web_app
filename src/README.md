Description of my thesis

The process of producing a new law in Greece is a rather complex and often multimonth process. This process of finalizing the law consists of three different stages.
These stages in chronological order are the public consultation of the law, its
elaboration by the committees of the parliament and finally its discussion and voting
in the parliament. It is also well known that the stage-by-stage transition brings about
modifications to the texts of the articles, which can be either deleting text, adding text
or modifying text.

The problem that has been identified and which was the reason for the realization of
this thesis is the fact that the modifications made to the articles are not concentrated in
a digital media or a platform, so that they are easily and quickly accessible to the
citizens. On the contrary, there are various websites such as opengov. gr,
hellenicparliament. gr and vouliwatch. gr which provide individual and incomparable
information.

This, as will be discussed in more detail in the following chapters, is achieved by
creating a web site whose content is manageable by Joomla! CMS and which
compiles and compares the contents of the articles from the beginning to the end of
the law. Therefore, my thesis comes to solve the problem and be a tool for
comprehensive monitoring of the "life cycle of laws".
